This Program we has to do with graph coloring. with the use of a graph and various of algorithms for coloring n vertices. 
We implemented the algorithms for coloring a graph G along with our currently running Lab10 graph class. The graph class 
contain updated methods for coloring the vertices and showing the status of the graph i.e. if two vertices conflict with 
one another (a conflict being an edge from u to v \in G). This program has a main.cpp where the courses are added and the
edges are determined based on the time of the courses conflict. This program has more that can be done to it, like making 
a user menu where they can input their classes, and then run our algorithm to see if any classes coflicts. We didn't have
time to do it but we paln to continue working on it to see if we can get that working


Bonus:
1. Put program on github
2. Do documentation on LaTex
